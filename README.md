## Hover Preview
This is a [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension that shows a preview when the cursor is hovered over certain items. 

This currently works with colors and images. If you can think of other things you'd like to see in the preview, please let me know,
or even better, submit a pull request.

## Usage

Copy this folder into the Brackets `extensions/user` folder and restart Brackets. When the cursor is over a color value or 
an image name, a preview of the color/image is shown.

## Future

Add UI to enable/disable the preview.
