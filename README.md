## Hover Preview
This is a [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension that shows a preview when the cursor is hovered over certain items. 

This currently works with gradients, colors and images. If you can think of other things you'd like to see in the preview, please let 
me know, or even better, submit a pull request.

## Usage

1. [Download](https://github.com/gruehle/HoverPreview/zipball/master) and unzip it; or clone this repo on GitHub
2. Copy the copied/cloned folder into the Brackets `extensions/user` folder
3. Restart Brackets. 

When the cursor is over a gradient value, color value or an image name, a preview of the value is shown.

## Screenshots

Here are a few screenshots of the extension in action.

## Future

Add plug-in mechanism so other value providers can be added.
