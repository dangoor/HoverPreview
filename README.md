## Hover Preview
This is a [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension that shows a preview when the cursor is hovered over certain items. 

This currently works with gradients, colors and images. If you can think of other things you'd like to see in the preview, please let 
me know, or even better, submit a pull request.

## Usage

Copy this folder into the Brackets `extensions/user` folder and restart Brackets. When the cursor is over a gradient value, color value or 
an image name, a preview of the value is shown.

## Future

Add plug-in mechanism so other value providers can be added.
